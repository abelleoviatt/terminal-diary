# terminal_diary
This is an easy-to-use, highly customizable note-taking and diary plugin that you can use for terminal.
Its great for jotting down ideas while coding and having to open a note-taking app like Evernote with your mouse would just take too long!
Cool Functionalities:
- Customize your bashrc so that you have custom commands to organize, compile and write notes (I've attached mine for reference)
